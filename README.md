# Purpose
### Project Pitch
There are a lot of child malnutrition nonprofits around the globe. Itâ€™s difficult to keep track of all the data for thousands of kids that are screened. This apps allows their data to be entered and saved, and tracked over time. It keeps records organized by both country name and community name.

### Why?
This was a project built during one of Lambda School's Build Weeks. As the Front End Developer, my role was to collaborate with the Back End Devleoper to build out a website with CRUD capabilties. Onboarding for new admins and new users were required as well.

## Install and Run

- Run the command `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to open using local server

## User Types

- As an administrator, you can log in and view, add, edit, and delete the list of countries associated with your organization. Your home page will display a global map with interactive capabilities. Clicking a selected (blue) country will bring you to that country's page. Clicking a unselected (gray) country will give you the option to add that country for your organization. You will then have all other functionalities of a normal user.
- As a user, you can log in and view, add, edit, and delete communities, children, and screenings for the country you are assigned to. 

## Dependencies
The app was built using `react`, `redux`, and `redux-thunk`. Components were built using `antd` and some styling was done with `styled-components` and `node-sass`. `Moment.js` was used for formatting the dates of the screenings and `axios` was used for the calls to the server. Lastly, `amcharts4` was used to build and display the Map on the admin home page and the line graph on the screening page. Please see their docs for additional information. 

## Future Ideas
- Ability to search on all pages, but the ability to search for a child on the home page would be ideal. With many communities, it can be challenging to remember which one to look in to find a child.
- Breadcrumbs to show the path taken through the pages.
- Ability to download screening data into an excel sheet
- Store more data for each child in the server. DOB would be ideal so age can be calulated for each screening.
